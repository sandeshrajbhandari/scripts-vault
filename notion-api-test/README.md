# Basic Notion API code used to access a database

I wrote this script to learn to use Notion API for making custom queries to the my databases.

In this example code, I am querying a database that stores production records from my work. I track daily production quantity of transformers from shot blasting records.

tip: using foreach with await doesn't work.

Console Output example:

KVA | Tank Cover | Tank | Conservator
300 | 256 | 199 | 204 |
200 | 378 | 371 | 435 |
100 | 218 | 134 | 289 |
50 | 328 | 141 | 90 |
90/15 | 176 | 157 | 0 |
25 | 233 | 253 | 0 |
